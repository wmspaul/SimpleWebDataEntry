# SimpleWebDataEntry

## Description
The following is a project proposed for an interview.
### Requirements
Using a tech stack of your choice (e.g., Python and Django, Java and Spring) develop a simple data entry web application.

This application should have a single form with inputs for:
·        Name
·        Age
·        Title
·        Hometown

The form should also have a single submit button.
Name and Title should be required fields, while the others are not. The system should display an error message if the required fields aren’t entered.
When the submit button is pressed, the application should take you to a confirmation page that has all of the information that was entered, as well as a table of previous entries.
Include some basic CSS styling on the page to make it look somewhat presentable.
